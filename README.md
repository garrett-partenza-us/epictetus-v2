# Overview
This is an ongoing project to use recent advancements in generative transformers to resurrect the lost works of Stoic philosphy. Open to community contributions. Catch up with my [blog post](https://garrett-partenza-us.github.io/blog/2022/07/14/silicondiscourses.html)

# The Idea
1. Train transformer model on Stoic text to predict the next word
2. Autoregress on fragments of lost text
3. Generate some remanence of the rest of the lost work.
