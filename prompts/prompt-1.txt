but if you really trust me it is plain that you trust me because i am faithful and modest not because i have told my affairs to you.
allow me then to have the same opinion about you.
show me that if one man tells his affairs to another he who tells them is faithful and modest.
for if this were so i would go about and tell my affairs to every man if that would make me faithful and modest.
    but the thing is not so and it requires no common opinions.
    if then you see a man who is busy about things not dependent on his will and subjecting his will to them you must know that this man has ten thousand persons to compel and hinder him.
        he has no need of pitch or the wheel to compel him to declare what he knows but a little girls nod if it should so happen will move him the blandishment of one who belongs to caesars court desire of a magistracy or of an inheritance and things without end of that sort.
        you must remember then among general principles that secret discourses require fidelity and corresponding opinions.
